# YASN - Yet Another Social Network.

## It was my attempt at building a social network mostly for educational purposes. It is a "work in progress" kind of thing, but it is unlikely to ever get finished since I've decided to build a better one from scratch with Next (which probably will never happen either).

## What's used (most notable)
### On the front:
1. React
2. Redux (toolkit)
3. SCSS
4. Bulma
4. Typescript

### On the back:
1. Express
2. MongoDB (Mongoose)
3. Javascript (couldn't get Typescript to work with GraphQL Server + undesired transpilation since it doesn't run natively on NodeJS)

Socket.io on both sides and Apollo/GraphQL initially (which was later replaced by Redux - weird, it's supposed to be the other way around)
